# Password Strength Checker (Easy to Use)

This is an easy-to-use Python script to test the strength of a password. It assists you in creating stronger, safer passwords by reviewing common errors and weak patterns.

## âœ… What It Inspects

- Is the password a minimum of 8 characters?
- Does it contain a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters?
- Does it contain numbers and special characters (such as @, #, $, etc.)?
- Does it use too many repeated characters?
- Is it a widely used password such as "123456" or "password"?
- Does it contain easy guesses like words or keyboard layouts such as "qwerty"?
- Does it contain your username (not secure!)?

##  How to Use

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Execute the script using:

   ```bash
   python password_checker.py
